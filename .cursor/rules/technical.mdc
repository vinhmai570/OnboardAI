- Adhere to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles throughout the codebase to minimize duplication and enhance maintainability.
- Encapsulate business logic within dedicated service objects, ensuring controllers and models remain focused and lightweight.
- Avoid "fat" controllers and models by delegating complex operations and workflows to service objects or other appropriate abstractions.
- Structure features to promote reusability, clarity, and separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to test, extend, and refactor.
- Ensure that an error is raised if the application cannot connect to OpenAI or if OpenAI is not properly configured, so that such issues are not silently ignored.
