# Inline Quiz Implementation

This document describes the implementation of inline quizzes within the course interface, allowing users to take quizzes without page reloads.

## Overview

The inline quiz system integrates quiz functionality directly into the course viewing experience. When users click on a quiz/assessment step in the course structure, the quiz loads dynamically in the main content area without page refreshes.

## Key Features

### ✅ **Seamless User Experience**
- No page redirects when clicking quiz steps
- Quiz loads inline within the course interface
- Maintains course navigation context
- Smooth transitions between course content and quizzes

### ✅ **Real-time Interactions**
- Auto-save progress every 2 minutes and on answer changes
- Live progress tracking with visual indicators
- Real-time timer countdown (when applicable)
- Instant feedback on question completion status

### ✅ **Full Quiz Functionality**
- Quiz introduction screen with instructions
- Interactive quiz-taking interface
- Progress bar and completion tracking
- Automatic and manual submission
- Results display with detailed feedback
- Retake functionality

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (JavaScript)

#### `course_docs_controller.js` Enhancements
- **`loadQuizContent()`**: Fetches quiz data via AJAX and renders inline
- **`renderQuizInterface()`**: Dynamically builds quiz UI based on attempt status
- **`startQuizAttempt()`**: Initiates new quiz attempts via API
- **`handleQuestionChange()`**: Manages answer interactions and auto-save
- **`submitQuizAttempt()`**: Submits completed quizzes
- **`saveQuizProgress()`**: Auto-saves progress periodically
- **Timer management**: Handles time limits with visual warnings
- **Notification system**: Shows user feedback for actions

#### Quiz UI Components
- **Introduction Screen**: Quiz details, instructions, and start button
- **Taking Interface**: Questions, options, progress tracking, submit controls
- **Results Screen**: Score display, feedback, retake options

### Backend (Rails)

#### `QuizzesController` JSON API
- **`show.json`**: Returns quiz data with questions and current attempt
- **`start.json`**: Creates new quiz attempts
- **`submit.json`**: Processes quiz submissions
- **`results.json`**: Returns attempt results and feedback
- **`save_progress.json`**: Auto-saves user responses

#### Data Flow
```
1. User clicks quiz step → JavaScript checks for quiz
2. If quiz exists → Load quiz data via AJAX
3. Render quiz interface inline → User interacts with questions
4. Auto-save progress → Submit when complete
5. Show results inline → Option to retake or continue course
```

## API Endpoints

### Quiz Data Retrieval
```
GET /quizzes/:id.json
Response: {
  quiz: { id, title, course_title, question_count, total_points, time_limit_minutes },
  current_attempt: { id, status, remaining_time_minutes } | null,
  questions: [{ id, question_text, question_type, points, options }],
  responses: { question_id: { selected_option_id, answer_text } },
  best_attempt: { score, percentage_score, passed } | null
}
```

### Quiz Operations
```
POST /quizzes/:id/start.json
Response: { success: true, attempt_id: 123 }

PATCH /quizzes/:id/save_progress.json
Body: { questions: { question_id: { selected_option_id, answer_text } } }
Response: { success: true, message: "Progress saved" }

PATCH /quizzes/:id/submit.json
Body: { questions: { question_id: { selected_option_id, answer_text } } }
Response: { success: true, attempt_id: 123 }

GET /quizzes/:id/results.json
Response: {
  attempt: { score, percentage_score, passed, time_spent_minutes },
  questions_with_responses: [{ question_text, user_answer, correct_answer, is_correct }]
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### 1. **Quiz Discovery**
- User navigates course structure
- Quiz steps are clearly marked with assessment badges
- Click on quiz step triggers inline loading

### 2. **Quiz Introduction**
- Overview of quiz details (questions, points, time limit)
- Display of best score (if previously attempted)
- Clear instructions and start button
- No page redirect required

### 3. **Quiz Taking**
- Questions presented with clear numbering and point values
- Multiple choice, true/false, and short answer support
- Progress bar shows completion percentage
- Timer display (when applicable) with visual warnings
- Auto-save functionality with user notifications
- Answer status indicators (answered/unanswered)

### 4. **Quiz Submission**
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental submission
- Real-time validation of form data
- Loading states during submission
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### 5. **Results Display**
- Immediate score feedback
- Detailed breakdown of correct/incorrect answers
- Performance statistics (time spent, accuracy)
- Options to retake quiz or continue course
- Seamless integration with course navigation

## Auto-Save Features

### Trigger Conditions
- 2 seconds after any answer change
- Every 2 minutes automatically
- Before page unload (if implemented)

### Data Persistence
- Individual question responses saved
- Progress state maintained
- Resume capability for incomplete attempts
- Graceful error handling for network issues

## Error Handling

### Network Errors
- Fallback to regular step content on API failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for critical operations
- Graceful degradation

### Validation Errors
- Form validation before submission
- Server-side error responses handled
- User feedback for corrective actions
- State preservation during errors

## Performance Optimizations

### AJAX Efficiency
- Minimal data transfer in API responses
- Efficient JSON serialization
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Caching considerations

### UI Responsiveness
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Mobile-responsive design
- Loading states for user feedback

## Security Considerations

### CSRF Protection
- Rails CSRF tokens included in all AJAX requests
- Proper authentication checks
- User session validation

### Data Validation
- Server-side validation of all inputs
- Sanitization of user responses
- Access control for quiz resources

## Integration Points

### Course Navigation
- Maintains breadcrumb context
- Preserves step selection states
- Seamless return to course content

### Progress Tracking
- Updates user progress records
- Course completion calculation
- Learning analytics integration

## Browser Support

### Requirements
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- JavaScript enabled
- AJAX/Fetch API support
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support

## Testing Considerations

### User Scenarios
- Quiz discovery and loading
