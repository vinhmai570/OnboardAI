# Developer Onboarding Guide

## Welcome to the Team!

This guide will help new developers get up and running with our development environment and processes.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Git (version 2.30 or higher)
- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- Docker Desktop
- VS Code or your preferred IDE

## Environment Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/company/project.git
cd project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Update the `.env` file with your local configuration values.

### 4. Database Setup

Start the database using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres
```

Run database migrations:

```bash
npm run migrate
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Use the following format for branch names:
- `feature/description-of-feature`
- `bugfix/description-of-bug`
- `hotfix/critical-issue`

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:
- `feat: add new feature`
- `fix: resolve bug`
- `docs: update documentation`
- `style: formatting changes`
- `refactor: code refactoring`
- `test: add or update tests`

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
2. **Make your changes** with clear, focused commits
3. **Write tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Link to related issues
   - Screenshots if UI changes
   - Test results

### Code Review Guidelines

As a reviewer:
- Be constructive and specific in feedback
- Suggest improvements with examples
- Approve when code meets standards
- Test functionality if possible

As an author:
- Respond to all feedback
- Make requested changes promptly
- Ask questions if feedback is unclear
- Request re-review after changes

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies

## Code Standards

### Style Guide

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
# Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format
```

### Best Practices

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow the DRY principle
- Handle errors gracefully

## Tools and Resources

### Development Tools

- **IDE**: VS Code with recommended extensions
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commits
- **Package Manager**: npm or yarn
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for code documentation

### Helpful Extensions for VS Code

- ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
- Prettier - Code formatter
- ESLint
- GitLens
- Thunder Client (for API testing)
- Docker

### Internal Resources

- **Design System**: Link to component library
- **API Documentation**: Link to API docs
- **Team Wiki**: Internal knowledge base
- **Slack Channels**: #development, #help, #random

## Getting Help

Don't hesitate to ask for help! Here are the best ways to get support:

1. **Slack**: Post in #development channel
2. **Pair Programming**: Schedule time with a senior developer
3. **Documentation**: Check our internal wiki first
4. **Stack Overflow**: For general programming questions

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Port Already in Use

If you get a "port already in use" error:

```bash
# Find process using the port
lsof -i :3000

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Database Connection Issues

If you can't connect to the database:

1. Make sure Docker is running
2. Check if the database container is up: `docker ps`
3. Restart the database: `docker-compose restart postgres`

### Module Not Found Errors

If you get module not found errors:

```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## Security Guidelines

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Report security issues immediately

## Performance Best Practices

- Optimize images and assets
- Use lazy loading where appropriate
- Minimize bundle sizes
- Cache frequently used data
- Monitor performance metrics

Remember: The best code is code that your future self and teammates can easily understand and maintain!
