## Feature Prioritization

### Prioritization Frameworks

**RICE Scoring**:
- **Reach**: How many users will be impacted?
- **Impact**: What's the impact on each user?
- **Confidence**: How confident are you in your estimates?
- **Effort**: How much work is required?

Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort

**MoSCoW Method**:
- **Must Have**: Critical features for launch
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Nice-to-have features
- **Won't Have**: Features to defer to future releases

**Kano Model**:
- **Basic Features**: Expected functionality (dissatisfaction if missing)
- **Performance Features**: Linear satisfaction increase with quality
- **Excitement Features**: Unexpected delights that differentiate

### Trade-off Decision Making

When faced with competing priorities, consider:
- **Business Impact**: Revenue potential and strategic alignment
- **User Value**: How much users will benefit from the feature
- **Technical Feasibility**: Development complexity and resource requirements
- **Time Constraints**: Launch deadlines and market timing
- **Competitive Pressure**: Features needed to maintain competitive position
