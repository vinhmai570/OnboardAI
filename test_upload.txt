Welcome to OnboardAI Test Document

This is a simple test document to verify automatic processing functionality.

Introduction
============
This document contains various sections to test the text chunking and processing capabilities of our system.

Features
========
1. Automatic text extraction from uploaded files
2. Intelligent text chunking for optimal AI processing
3. Background job processing for scalability
4. Real-time status updates for users

Benefits
========
The automatic processing system provides several key benefits:
- Immediate processing without manual intervention
- Scalable architecture using background jobs
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Clear status feedback to users

Technical Implementation
=======================
The system uses Rails Active Job for background processing, with the following components:
- DocumentProcessingService for text extraction and chunking
- EmbeddingGenerationJob for AI vector creation
- Status tracking for user feedback

This test document should be automatically processed into several text chunks when uploaded through the OnboardAI interface.

Conclusion
==========
The automatic processing feature ensures that uploaded documents are immediately available for AI-powered course generation and content analysis.
